    "# Predicting heart disease using machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "In a statement,\n",
    "> Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not the have heart disease?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The original data came from the Cleveland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.\n",
    "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a version of it available on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cherngs/heart-disease-cleveland-uci\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "> If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, we'll pursue the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Features\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where you'll get different information about each of the features in your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Create data dictionary**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 14 attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. age: age in years\n",

    "    -- Value 1: atypical angina\n",
    "    -- Value 2: non-anginal pain\n",
    "    -- Value 3: asymptomatic\n",
    "4. trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)\n",
    "5. chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl\n",
    "6. fbs: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)\n",
    "7. restecg: resting electrocardiographic results\n",
    "    -- Value 0: normal\n",
    "    -- Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)\n",
    "    -- Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria\n",
    "8. thalach: maximum heart rate achieved\n",
    "9. exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)\n",
    "10. oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest\n",
    "11. slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment\n",
    "    -- Value 0: upsloping\n",
    "    -- Value 1: flat\n",
    "    -- Value 2: downsloping\n",
    "12. ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy\n",
    "13. thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect\n",
